# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I took STATS 101 back in semester 1 and really enjoyed it, wanting to continue trying new subjects that branch out of my degree.
- I am interested in learning about R because it's a very helpful language that helps with reading and analyzing data
